# Exploring the Divvy (Chicago) Bike Sharing System Network

 In this project I explored a 12-month sample of bike-share data from the Divvy bike-sharing system
in Chicago and incorporated network analysis of the data to identify key stations and community
structures. As a result of the large size of data obtained for just one year, a 10% stratified random
sample was drawn to ease computational burden without compromising the representativeness of the
data population. Bike share users in chicago use bike share for both one-way trips and round trips,
but mostly one-way trips, and throughout the weekdays and on weekends, with casual users making
more rides on weekends than on weekdays and vice versa for members. The analysis revealed that
the Streeter Dr & Grand Avenue bike station is the most central station, while the State St & 95th
St station appeared to be the most critical to information flow in the bike-share network. there were
many Divvy bike-share stations with low usage of public bikes. The bike-share network can be thought
of as involving one big giant component which suggests that similar strategies can be adopted to bring
improvement in ridership across all or most of the stations.
